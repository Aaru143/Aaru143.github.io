                        For our porject we have used the data collected by FBI(Federal Bureau Of Investigation) under its UCR(Uniform Crime Reporting) Program. The objective of this program is to collect reliable information for use in law enforcement administration, operation, and management; over the years. Over the years, this data has become one of the country's leading social indicators.
